Designing a retail and restaurant SaaS POS solution end to end. Payrrot is a free service offered by restaurants, supermarts and convenience stores. Payrrot allows shoppers to skip the checkout line and simply pay and walk out after scanning the code in their Payrrot app. I worked with some amazing folks to build the product (PWA) Zero to One.
